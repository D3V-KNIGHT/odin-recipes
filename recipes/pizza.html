    </p>
    <p>This recipe calls for fresh ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound refrigerated pizza dough</li>
      <li>¼ cup pizza sauce</li>
      <li>½ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>½ cup sliced pepperoni</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place pizza stone on grill directly over wood fire. You may need to
        begin by spreading out the wood if the flames are too tall. Roll out the
        pizza dough to desired thickness. Place it on the pizza stone and cook
        10 minutes on one side until golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the fire and on the cooked side, spread the pizza sauce in
        an even layer over dough leaving about a half inch around the rim of the
        pizza dough bare. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese evenly on top of the sauce,
        followed by the pepperoni slices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place uncooked side down, back on the pizza stone. Cover with a foil
        tent and cook until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes more. Transfer
        pizza to a cutting board and let cool slightly before cutting and
        serving.
